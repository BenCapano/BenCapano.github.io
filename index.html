<ul>
<li><a href=https://bencapano.itch.io/legend-of-zelda>The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></li>
<div>
    <p>I developed most of the weapons, worked with the audio components, and implemented some of the unique rooms.</p>
    <p>I used C# and Unity to complete this project.</p>
</div>
<li><a href=https://bencapano.itch.io/puzzle-ice-battle>Puzzle Ice Battle</a></li>
<div>
    <p>This was a solo project so I completed all the work, with some help from the links in credits.txt</p>
</div>
<li><a href=https://bencapano.itch.io/carrots-in-space>Carrots in Space</a></li>
<div>
    <p>I worked mainly on mechanics and game objects, including the lasers and their interaction with the carrots, the gravity obstacles, and the shooting ship enemy.</p>
    <p>I also worked on some of the UI, including working on the level and world select views.</p>
    <p>Other help we got can be found in the credits.txt file in the downloadable zip folder.</p>
